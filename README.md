# Automated flow to create a classifier capable of determining a plantâ€™s species from a photo.
* Import the data. Analyze the dimensions of the data. Visualize the data.
* Design, train tune, and test the best AIML image classifier model using
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Neural networks
- CNN
* Compare the results from the above step to choose the best-performing algorithm.
* Pickle the best-performing model.
* Import the test image to predict the class. Display the image. Use the best-trained image classifier model to predict the class
* The Plant Seedlings Dataset contains images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.
 It comprises annotated RGB images with roughly 10 pixels per mm physical resolution.
