# Automated flow to create a classifier capable of determining a plantâ€™s species from a photo.
* Import the data. Analyze the dimensions of the data. Visualize the data.
* Design, train tune, and test the best AIML image classifier model using
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Neural networks
- CNN
* Compare the results from the above step to choose the best-performing algorithm.
* Pickle the best-performing model.
* Import the test image to predict the class. Display the image. Use the best-trained image classifier model to predict the class
* Technology Used: Python
